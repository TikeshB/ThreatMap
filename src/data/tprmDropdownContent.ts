        content: `What is it
Every organization today relies on third parties—vendors, suppliers, technology partners, contractors, or service providers. While these partnerships drive efficiency and growth, they also introduce risks that can directly impact your security posture, compliance obligations, and business continuity.

Our Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) Framework service helps you build a structured, scalable, and regulatory-aligned program that identifies, assesses, monitors, and mitigates risks across the entire vendor lifecycle.

Our Methodology
We adopt a structured, phased approach tailored to your organization’s context:

1. Discovery & Strategy Development: Understand your business objectives, regulatory requirements (GDPR, DPDP Act, ISO 27001, etc.), and risk appetite. Map your current vendor ecosystem, including critical and non-critical dependencies.

2. Framework & Policy Design: Draft the TPRM policy and governance charter. Develop standardized risk assessment templates and reporting formats.

3. Process Development: Establish vendor onboarding, due diligence, and approval workflows. Build monitoring processes for ongoing compliance and risk tracking. Define exit and offboarding controls to manage end-of-contract risks.

4. Implementation & Training: Deploy the framework in collaboration with procurement, legal, compliance, and IT teams. Conduct training and awareness sessions for stakeholders to ensure adoption.

Why It Matters
- Prevent Security Breaches: Reduce the likelihood of third-party incidents impacting your systems.

- Ensure Regulatory Compliance: Meet requirements under GDPR, DPDP Act, HIPAA, and global standards.

- Operational Resilience: Minimize supply chain disruptions and financial/reputation risks.

- Cost-Effective Decision Making: Evaluate vendors not just on cost and performance, but on risk posture.

- Board-Level Visibility: Provide clear insights and metrics to management for informed oversight.`

        title: "Policy and procedure development aligned with ISO 27001, NIST, RBI, and other standards",
        content: `What It Is
Policies and procedures are the blueprint of an organization’s governance and security posture. They translate high-level objectives into clear, actionable, and auditable practices that employees can consistently follow. Without them, even the most advanced security controls lack structure and accountability.

Our service focuses on developing tailored security policies, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and governance documents that are:

- Aligned with global frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, CIS Controls, COBIT)

- Compliant with regulatory requirements (RBI Cybersecurity Framework, DPDP Act, sectoral mandates)

- Practical and organization-specific, avoiding “one-size-fits-all” templates

Our Methodology
We follow a structured, collaborative, and standards-driven process:

1. Scoping & Standards Mapping: Identify applicable regulations, frameworks, and business drivers.

2. Workshops & Current-State Review: Engage with stakeholders to understand existing practices and gaps.

3. Policy Drafting & Control Integration: Draft policies and SOPs mapped to ISO, NIST, or regulatory controls.

4. Stakeholder Review & Refinement: Ensure policies are realistic, implementable, and align with organizational culture.

5. Finalization, Approval & Rollout: Deliver complete, audit-ready documentation in a structured format.

Why It Matters
- Audit & Certification Readiness: Demonstrates compliance during ISO 27001, SOC 2, RBI, or regulator audits.

- Consistent Security Practices: Eliminates ambiguity by providing employees with clear, written guidance.

- Incident Preparedness: Outlines defined responsibilities during incidents to reduce delays and missteps.

- Stronger Governance: Acts as defensible evidence of commitment to security and compliance.

Key Deliverables
- Information Security Policies (Access Control, Data Protection, Acceptable Use, Incident Response, etc.)

- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for critical security functions

- Control Mapping Matrix (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, RBI Cybersecurity Framework, etc.)

- ISMS Documentation Framework (manuals, policies, procedures, guidelines, records)

- Role-specific RACI Matrix (defining responsibilities across security functions)`

        title: "Risk scoring model and risk-tiering methodology",
        content: `What is it
Every organization faces risks—some small and manageable, others potentially catastrophic. Identifying them is only the first step. The real challenge lies in determining which risks demand immediate action and which can be monitored or accepted. Without a structured approach, organizations often end up either chasing low-impact issues or being blindsided by the truly critical ones.

Our service addresses this challenge by helping organizations move from awareness to action. We design and implement a customized Risk Scoring Model and Tiering Methodology that transforms subjective risk lists into a structured, prioritized, and defensible action plan. This enables leadership to make faster, more confident decisions while ensuring resources are focused on the threats that matter most.

Our Process: A Collaborative and Analytical Approach
We follow a structured yet collaborative process to ensure the methodology fits seamlessly into your organization:

1. Context & Risk Appetite Workshop: We engage with leadership to understand strategic goals, compliance drivers, and the organization’s tolerance for different types of risk (e.g., financial vs. reputational).

2. Scale Definition & Customization: Through facilitated workshops, we co-create your Impact and Likelihood scales, ensuring the thresholds are meaningful and realistic for your environment.

3. Model Design & Validation: We design the scoring formula (often Impact × Likelihood or weighted variants) and define thresholds for tiering. We then validate the model using a sample of your real risks to confirm logical and defensible results.

4. Documentation & Guideline Creation: A formal methodology document is developed, clearly explaining the framework, scoring process, and decision rules. This ensures repeatability and consistency across the enterprise.

5. Training & Handover: We deliver training sessions for your teams, ensuring they are confident in applying the methodology. By the end, your organization owns the process and can apply it independently.

        content: `What is it?
Managing third-party risks can feel like navigating a maze. As your business grows, so does your network of vendors, suppliers, and partners—each bringing potential vulnerabilities. Manually tracking these risks is not only inefficient but also prone to critical oversights that could expose sensitive data, disrupt operations, or damage your reputation. At RNR Consulting Pvt. Ltd., our services for Evaluation and/or Integration of Automated TPRM Platforms simplify this complexity, helping you select and implement the right technology to continuously monitor and manage your third-party risks with precision and ease. RNR empowers you to transform a sprawling network of risks into a streamlined, secure operation.

Why Automated TPRM Platforms Matter
Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) is crucial for any organization that relies on external vendors for services, software, or data processing. Without a robust automated platform, you face significant challenges:

- Manual Overload: Relying on spreadsheets and manual checks makes it nearly impossible to keep up with the risk profiles of numerous third parties, leading to missed deadlines and outdated assessments.

- Blind Spots: Without real-time monitoring and comprehensive data, you may be unaware of critical security vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, or performance issues within your vendor ecosystem.

- Compliance Lapses: Many regulations require documented due diligence and continuous monitoring of third parties. Manual processes struggle to meet these stringent requirements, risking fines and legal repercussions.

- Slow Onboarding: Inefficient vendor assessment processes can delay the onboarding of new partners, impacting business agility and time-to-market for new initiatives.

- Reactive Response: Without an integrated platform, identifying and responding to a third-party incident (like a data breach at a vendor) becomes a chaotic and time-consuming scramble, exacerbating potential damage.
